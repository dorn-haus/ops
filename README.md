# Home K8s Cluster

> Home IPv6-friendly Flux-managed K8s cluster on Talos+Alpine.

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps config files
for managing my hobby cluster in the basement. Inspired by popular repos like
[toboshii/home-ops] and [Euvaz/GitOps-Home], with a few addicional
considerations:

[toboshii/home-ops]: https://github.com/toboshii/home-ops
[Euvaz/GitOps-Home]: https://github.com/Euvaz/GitOps-Home

- **🛠️ Unconventional hardware:** As much as I enjoy automating the software
  infrastructure, I also really like building custom hardware to power it all.
  I spend maybe half the time in front of the ⌨️ keyboard and half the time
  using 🪚🪛 power tools.
- **🌳 Low footprint:** All of the nodes are either old machines I am no longer
  using, or used machines I bought for very cheap. Many use passive cooling.
- **6️⃣ IPv6 networking:** The goal is to manage the entire cluster via IPv6, and
  maybe one day disable IPv4 networking entirely.

##  🧑‍💻️ development / operations

The easiest way to get the required dependencies is to have `nix` and `direnv`
configured. Entering the repo will execute the [`.envrc` file], which in turn
will `use flake` to pull in dependencies from the `flake.nix` file.

[`.envrc` file]: https://github.com/attilaolah/ops/blob/main/.envrc

Without `direnv`, one would need to manually run `nix develop` to manually
enter the development shell.

## 6️⃣ IPv6-only networking

Enabling IPv6 tends to work just fine. Disabling IPv4 (as much as possible) is
when things start to go south. There are a surprising number of popular
domains, for example, that don't seem to have AAAA records yet. *I know, WTF,
right?*

At least the following workarounds are necessary:

- **Time Servers**: `time.cloudflare.com` is a decent alternative that supports
  IPv6.
- **DNS (nameservers)**: Again Cloudflare provides fast public IPv6 nameservers:
  `2606:4700:4700::1001` and `2606:4700:4700::1111`.
- **Container registries**: There is a nice summary this comment:
  https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/89#issuecomment-772644009. At the
  time of writing, `mirror.gcr.io` seems to be a good alternative.

## 🚧 Under Construction

There is an existing repository where I already have most of these configs,
however it contains various secrets that are not properly extracted out. This
is an attempt to migrate exsting configs and redact any secrets.
